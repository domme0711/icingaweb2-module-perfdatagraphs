# Configuration

This describes the configuration options for the "frontend module".

Each individual "backend module", which is responsible for fetching the data from a performance data backend (Graphite, OpenSearch, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, etc.), has it's own configuration options.

## Performance Data Backend

Hint: If you only installed one backend module, it will be used by default. No need for configuration.

1. Install the Icinga Web Performance Data Graphs backend module you need (depending on where Icinga2 sends its data)
2. If there is more than one, configure the backend using the `Configuration → Modules → Performance Data Graphs → General` menu

## Time Range

The value for the "Current" time range button can be configured.
These buttons use ISO8601 durations in the background (e.g. PT3H, P1D, P1Y).

By default it uses `PT12H` meaning, 12 hours.

## Custom Variables

Icinga custom variables can be used to modify the rendering of graphs.

| Custom Variable Name  | Function |
|---------|--------|
| perfdatagraphs_config_disable (bool) | Disable graphs for this object |
| perfdatagraphs_config_backend (string) | Set a specific backend for this object |
| perfdatagraphs_config_highlight (string) | Set the specified metric to be highlighted |
| perfdatagraphs_metrics (dictionary)  | Modify a specific graphs for this object |
| perfdatagraphs_config_metrics_include (array[string]) | Include only the specified metrics for this object |
| perfdatagraphs_config_metrics_exclude (array[string]) | Exclude the specified metrics for this object |

### perfdatagraphs_config_disable

The custom variable `perfdatagraphs_config_disable (bool)` is used to disable a specific graph.

```
apply Service "icinga" {
  vars.perfdatagraphs_config_disable = true
}
```

### perfdatagraphs_config_backend

The custom variable `perfdatagraphs_config_backend (string)` is used to set a specific backend for an object.
The backend is specified via its name, see available backends in the module configuration.

```
apply Service "users" {
  vars.perfdatagraphs_config_backend = "MyCustomGraphiteBackend"
}
```

If the backend is not available no data will be returned.

### perfdatagraphs_config_highlight

The custom variable `perfdatagraphs_config_highlight (string)` is used to highlight a specific metric.
This means that it will be the top most graph shown.

```
apply Service "ping6" {
  vars.perfdatagraphs_config_highlight = "rta"
}
```

If the given metric is unavailable, the order given by the backend will be used.

### perfdatagraphs_metrics

The custom variables `perfdatagraphs_metrics (dictionary)` is used to modify a specific graph:

- `unit`, unit of this metric that should be displayed
- `fill`, color of the inside of the graph
- `stroke` color of the line of the graph

The variable `perfdatagraphs_metrics` is a dictionary, its keys are the name of the metric
you want to modify. Examples:

```
apply Service "apt" {
  // Set or override a unit for a metric
  vars.perfdatagraphs_metrics["available_upgrades"] = {
    unit = "packages"
  }

  // Set specific colors for a metric
  vars.perfdatagraphs_metrics["critical_updates"] = {
    unit = "packages"
    fill = "rgba(255, 0, 30, 0.3)"
    stroke = "rgba(255, 0, 30, 1)"
  }
}
```

The `unit` option can be any string, however, some unit of measurement can be used to apply custom formatting:

- `unit = "bytes"`
- `unit = "seconds"`
- `unit = "percentage"`

**Hint:** Be aware that Icinga2 sends normalized performance data to the backend (e.g. a check plugin that returns `ms` will be `s` in the backend).

### perfdatagraphs_config_metrics_include/exclude

The custom variable `perfdatagraphs_config_metrics_include (array[string])` is used to select specific metrics that
should be rendered, if not set all metrics are rendered. Wildcards can be used with: `*`.

The custom variable `perfdatagraphs_config_metrics_exclude (array[string])` is used to exclude a metric.
This takes precedence over the include. Wildcards can be used with: `*`.

Examples:

```
apply Service "icinga" {
  vars.perfdatagraphs_config_metrics_include = ["uptime", "*_latency"]
  vars.perfdatagraphs_config_metrics_exclude = ["avg_latency"]
}
```

## Director Integration

Custom variables as dictionaries aren't available as in the DSL, thus to provide customvars for specific graphs you need to use the Director baskets.

The graphs module provides a few basic baskets to change the behaviour of graphs, those can be found in `templates/director`. 

Syntax of those baskets are pretty straight forward and can therefore be easily modified if needed. 
Copy the following example into a file, change the variables and names to your liking and import them via baskets. 

```
{
    "ServiceTemplate": {
        "perfdatagraphs_ping4": {
            "check_command": "ping4",
            "fields": [],
            "object_name": "perfdatagraphs_ping4",
            "object_type": "template",
            "vars": {
                "perfdatagraphs_config_highlight": "rta",
                "perfdatagraphs_metrics": {
                    "pl": {
                        "unit": "%"
                    },
                    "rta": {
                        "unit": "ms"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

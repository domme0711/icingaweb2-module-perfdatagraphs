This module aims to be a "batteries included" and opinionated solution.
Configuration options are limited by design.

Documentation for this module is available at [doc](doc/).

# Known Issues

### Inconsistent collapsible behavior during autorefresh

When there are mulitple graphs on the page
the autorefresh can sometimes cause inconsistent collapsible behavior.

# Road to Version 1.0.0

What our current idea for a version 1.0.0 of this module is:

* It should work with every Icinga performance data writer with minimal configuration by the user
* It should be a robust solution for all check plugins
* It should integrate seamlessly in the Icinga Web UI, without degrading performance
  (e.g. when a plugin lots of data)
* It should provide enough options for customization for most use cases
